        <p>We excel at learning about your biggest pain points and envisioning solutions that eliminate the tedious repetitive tasks that time away from actualizing your mission. We then design solutions that automate those tasks, so that your team can focus on other essential tasks. Our expertise is primarily with building web applications, that require the recording and sharing of information, collaboration, web-based databases, and coordination tools.</p>

        <p>If you are facing challenges with sharing, storing or accessing data for your organization, we would like to support you in developing a solution. Our expertise includes a vast variety of technology solutions and we would love to partner with and create one for you!</p>

        <p><strong>Ruby for Good projects are built at no cost to our nonprofit partners and are completely FREE!</strong> We do this to support organizations that are dedicated to serving marginalized communities and making the world a better place. </p>

        <p>For the past three years we have been very fortunate to have received sponsorships from hosting companies to host projects that we have built for our nonprofit partners. However, continued sponsorship is not guaranteed and your organization may need to find either sponsored hosting or fund the hosting for the project once it is built. We will work with you to find the most affordable solution for your project or to integrate it with your current hosting.</p>

        <p>We estimate that an average project costs anything from $50,000- 85,000 in in-kind donations to build, so your commitment and partnership is crucial to the success of this huge investment from our volunteer contributors, and hosting partners. We require that you commit to at least two meetings with the Ruby for Good Project Lead prior to the beginning of the project, who will be managing and driving your project, and to meetings as needed, while it is being built.</p>

        <p>We will also require your participation, input, and feedback as the project is underway and being built, and your support to test it and provide feedback once it has been launched. We will continue to provide ongoing technical support and maintenance for as long as you use the product. </p>

        <p>After you submit your project request, a Project Lead will reach out to set up an initial conversation to determine how we can best assist you. Occasionally, it turns out that your best solution is to use something already on the market. If that is the case, we will support you with our best technical advice on launching and using that solution. </p>
