        <br />
        <h4>Developers</h4>
        <p>
          As a volunteer developer, you would have the opportunity to hone your skills by serving as a technical lead, architect, or an individual contributor.
        </p>
        <h4>Product Managers</h4>
        <p>
          We work with individuals and organizations on the front-lines to make the world better, at food banks, animal shelters, diaper banks, foster children advocacy groups, environmental conservation groups, and more. We need product leads who have an interest in building relationships with stakeholders, understanding their needs, and translating those need back to our teams of developers and designers.
        </p>
        <h4>User Experience and Design</h4>
        <p>
          Creating unique and functional experiences for our non-profit organizations, who range from technology novices to advanced users, is truly vital to the success of the technology solutions we build. Opportunities to center solutions around usability abound, and these are greatly valued by our partners.

          There are innumerable nonprofits both nationally and internationally that need our support that we are unable to work with, given our limited capacity. We are looking individuals to take leadership roles and both drive existing projects and start new ones, so we are able to serve more non-profit organizations in more communities, which is more critical now than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an incredible opportunity to forge remarkable relationships, have ownership over a project making a difference in the world, and gain the experience of driving a project from inception to delivery, and beyond.
