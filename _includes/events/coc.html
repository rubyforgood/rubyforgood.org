        <p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Ruby for Good/Ruby by the Bay team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission, including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>
        <p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they’re participating within this community and its project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors, and those seeking help and guidance.</p>
        <p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it is intended—a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>
        <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Ruby for Good/Ruby by the Bay team, including the venue. This includes IRC, Slack, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, Ruby for Good/Ruby by the Bay events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication.</p>
        <p>Be welcoming, friendly, and patient. Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will effect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.</p>
        <p>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Ruby for Good/Ruby by the Bay community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside of our communities.</p>
        <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="coc">
          <li class="coc">Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
          <li class="coc">Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
          <li class="coc">Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
          <li class="coc">Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (a.k.a. “doxing”).</li>
          <li class="coc">Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
          <li class="coc">Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
          <li class="coc">Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
          <li class="coc">Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Ruby is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Ruby comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere; rather offer to help resolve issues and learn from mistakes.</p>
        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. The organizers and volunteers will be introduced at the beginning of the event.</p>
        <p>Ruby for Good/Ruby by the Bay organizers will be happy to help participants contact local or site law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment in order for them to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value you and your attendance.</p>
        <p>We’re people trying to make the world better.</p>
