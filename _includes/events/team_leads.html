          So you’re considering leading a team for Ruby for Good. You’re probably wondering what the heck that means. We’ve assembled some info on:

          As a team lead you will be connecting with a partner organization that has a non-profit or civic mandate and work to deliver them software in support of their mission. This entails everything from meeting with the stakeholders, gathering requirements, translating those requirements, providing initial architecting, planning out project milestones, communicating with Ruby for Good organizers, pitching your project to Ruby for Good attendees, leading your team at the event July 28–31, and then seeing the project through to completion.

          <li class="bulleted">
            <b>Decision making.</b> Developers have lots and lots of opinions and we love to debate. I think we’ve all seen the rabbit hole we can fall down when people start discussing things like vim vs emacs, angular vs react, and so on. The team lead needs to be able to make decisions and keep the project moving forward.
          </li>
          <li class="bulleted">
            <b>Communication.</b> You will need to translate what the organization's needs are to your team. This also means that when your team is deciding how to build the app, you can effectively communicate the stakeholder,s needs if you have to reign in your team and prevent over-engineering what otherwise would be a simple solution.
          </li>
          <li class="bulleted">
            <b>Empathy.</b> We all participate because we are interested in making the world a better place. If we start with that belief, we realize that some problems form because people care too much.

          <strong>
            You may have noticed that we didn't list technical skills. The truth is that generally if you've been doing development for a year, you likely have the ability needed to lead a team. We'd love for you to get in touch about a project. Don't worry if you think you're missing some of the required skills. We're about learning and are happy to help and work with you to figure out a way to make it happen. Maybe that means a co-lead or appointing a technical decision-maker on your team. If you want to lead a team, we're committed to figuring out a strategy to make it work!

          We encourage you to reach out to past team leads and ask them about their experiences! It's a lot of fun, great for the resume, and extremely rewarding. <a href="http://www.blrice.net/blog/2015/08/10/leading-a-team-at-ruby-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read a blog post about a past team lead's experience with their first time leading a Ruby for Good project.</a>
