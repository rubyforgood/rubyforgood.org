          As a team lead, you will be connecting with a partner organization that has a non profit or civic mandate and work to deliver them software in support of their mission. This entails everything from meeting with the stakeholders, gathering requirements, translating those requirements, providing initial architecting, planning out project milestones, communicating with Ruby for Good organizers, pitching your project to Ruby for Good attendees, leading your team at the event, and seeing the project through to completion.

If you work late into the evenings, you miss out on playing board games and Werewolf and we want to see your face during these social times!

          <li class="bulleted">
            <b>Decision making.</b> Developers have lots and lots of opinions and we love to debate. I think we’ve all seen the rabbit hole we can fall down when people start discussing things like vim vs. emacs, angular vs. react, and so on. The team lead needs to be able to make decisions and keep the project moving forward.

          <li class="bulleted">
            <b>Communication.</b> You will need to translate the organization's needs to your team. This also means that when your team is deciding how to build the app, you must be able to effectively prevent your team from over-engineering what otherwise could be a simple solution.

            You may have noticed that we didn't list technical skills. The truth is that generally if you've been doing development for a year, you likely have the ability needed to lead a team. We'd love for you to get in touch about a project! Don't worry if you think you're missing some of the required skills. We're all about learning and will work with you to provide the support you need to be a successful team lead. Maybe that means co-leading a team or working alongside a technical decision-maker. If you want to lead a team, we're committed to figuring out a strategy to make it happen!
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage you to reach out to past team leads and ask them about their experiences! It's a lot of fun, great for the resume, and extremely rewarding. Read about a past team lead's first time leading a Ruby for Good project here:
