        <p>
          The Ruby for Good DC Area Conference is an annual event based out of the DC metro area where engineers, designers, product managers, and other gooders from all over the globe get together over a long weekend to collaboratively build projects in service of our communities. Gooders stay on-site, and hacking and socializing takes place in communal areas. Questions? Check out the <a href="/events/faq">FAQ</a> or drop us a note on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/rubyforgood/shared_invite/zt-21pyz2ab8-H6JgQfGGI0Ab6MfNOZRIQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:info@rubyforgood.org" target="_blank">info@rubyforgood.org</a>.

          This year we are returning to <a href="https://www.shepherdsspring.org/facilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shepherd's Spring Camp & Retreat Center</a> in the woods, about an hour outside of DC. With the stress of the past few years, we want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the cities to a place where we can destress with our friends both new and old. Spending time in nature is good for you. Don't take it from us, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-nature-can-solve-life-s-most-challenging-problems-ncna749361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that's just science</a>! Plus, eating s'mores in front of a campfire after a day of civic hacking is pretty much the best thing ever.

        <h3 id="how-does-it-work" class="faq-title">How Does Ruby for Good Work?</h3>
        <p>
          This is an event for people of <em>all</em> skill levels so even if you are new, we won't let that prevent you from contributing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Attendees self-select into projects that are meaningful to them and then the fun begins! Most projects have a need for a variety of skills including developers, designers, and product managers. While most of our attendees use Ruby, we welcome programmers of other languages, especially if you’re interested in learning some Ruby!
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="far fa-smile maize-crayola-dark"></i> Past years have benefited from attendees with JavaScript, architecture, and design skills as well.

        <p>
          During registration we’ll ask if you’d like to lead a team — say yes! We’ll be in touch in early April with potential projects – both new and existing ones. We’ll brief you on expectations and put you in touch with your nonprofit. You'll work with them in advance of the event to take care of project requirements, milestones, and initial setup so you can hit the ground running with your team at Ruby for Good. For new projects, setup includes creating a GitHub repo under the Ruby for Good GitHub, filing issues to work off of during the event, and making some technology suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry! Team leads don’t work alone; most projects have multiple leads working together as a group. There are also several people who help across the teams that you can get support from. If you want to know what it will be like to lead a team this year, <a href="/events/team-leads">read our team lead guide</a>. For an in-depth look from a past year's team lead, check out Brandon Rice’s blog post, <a href="http://www.blrice.net/blog/2015/08/10/leading-a-team-at-ruby-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading a Team at Ruby for Good</a>.

          Several of our projects could benefit from a weekend's worth of focused gooding and it gives us a chance to share the Ruby for Good experience with more folks.

        <p>
          All experience levels are definitely welcome! We have a wide variety of skill levels – some people have next to no experience in programming, whereas other have decades – but the same applies to other areas too! We have a wide variety of skill levels in pair programming, teaching, product building – and these don’t necessarily correlate with years of programming experience. The event is as much about learning as it is about building great things. Groups are very collaborative and you’ll definitely have the opportunity to work closely with others and push a lot of code. <i class="far fa-smile maize-crayola-dark"></i>

          No. This is definitely not a hackathon. Sean cringes everytime someone mentions 'hackathon' and 'Ruby for Good' in the same sentence. (Try it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference? A hackathon often ends up in a lot of code that isn't used beyond the event. We have people actively using our codebases! It feels very different to have a client/stakeholder excited to use your work and helping to direct what we do.
