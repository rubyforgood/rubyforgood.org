          The Ruby for Good DC Area Conference is an annual event based out of the DC area where engineers, designers,
          product managers, and other gooders from all over the globe get together over a long weekend to
          collaboratively build projects in service of our communities. Gooders stay on-site, and hacking and
          socializing takes place in communal areas. Questions? Check out the <a href="/events/faq">FAQ</a> or drop us a

          This year we are returning to <a href="https://www.shepherdsspring.org/facilities" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Shepherd's Spring Camp & Retreat Center</a> in the woods, about an hour outside of
          DC. With the stress of the past year, we want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the cities to a place
          where we can destress with our friends both new and old. Spending time in nature is good for you. Don't take
          it from us, <a

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that's just science</a>! Plus, eating s'mores in front of a
          campfire after a day of civic hacking is pretty much the best thing ever. </p>

          We're very proud to once again be organizing the Ruby for Good DC conference. This conference, to our
          knowledge, is the first and currently only conference of this kind ever. We are bringing together
          technologists to learn, teach, and work on civic and open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why Sponsor?</strong></p>
        <p>
          By the very nature of our conference, our attendees are some of the most passionate, connected, and involved
          in the Ruby community. For companies looking to hire, this is an excellent opportunity to meet and interact
          professionally and socially with prospective candidates. By sponsoring, you are demonstrating your commitment
          to your community, open source, and the Ruby community as a whole.
