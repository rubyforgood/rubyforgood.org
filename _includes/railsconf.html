          Tech conferences are fun! Especially when you have friends attending the conference with you, and even more
          so, when you can make new friends. We might be biased (okay, we're totally biased) but we think that
          <em>gooders</em> (individuals and organizations that give their time and talent in service of their
          communities, to make the world gooder), are by far some of the best people around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join a group of gooders, on May 16, 2022, the day before RailsConf begins, to make an impact in the Portland
          community. Build your network, make friends, and socialize, while learning about interesting conference
          sessions to attend, discovering the best local coffee shops, and enjoying lunch with an amazing group of
          people.
        </p>

        <p>
          No family should have to choose between purchasing food or diapers for their children. <a
            href="https://www.pdxdiaperbank.org">The
            Portland Diaper
            Bank's</a> mission is to provide no cost diapering supplies to low-income and houseless families.

          We will be partnering with Portland Diaper Bank to help assemble and package diapers and period supplies into
          bundles that are easy to distribute to partner agencies and through them, to the community.

          This meaningful work is done for the most part by volunteers, like us, and enables the Portland Diaper Bank to
          continue its critical work in the community.

          In addition to being important work, it is also a lot of fun, and a lovely time to connect with like-minded
          gooders. We've seen volunteering sessions like this one, lead to long-term friendships and professional
          opportunities.

          We will meet in the lobby of the conference hotel, the <a
            href="https://www.hilton.com/en/attend-my-event/rllc-dt-rbc-3d1f0384-4813-4829-9bf2-8788008ece79/">Double
            Tree Portland</a>, and will announce a time closer to the date. While we don't have the exact time yet, we
          will likely be leaving from the hotel around noon. We will coordinate rideshares and head
          to the volunteering venue together. Although, you are welcome to meet us there if it is more convenient for
          you.

        <p>
          We will spend approximately 1-2 hours volunteering at the Portland Diaper Bank, after which we will head to a
          local restaurant/brewery for lunch and socializing.

          As with all Ruby for Good events, we have some super fun ice-breaker conversation topics lined up, and we're
          really excited to make new ruby friends!
