    - paragraph: "We believe that volunteers are able to more fully engage in projects when they are able to connect with the nonprofit organizations they are supporting, on a deeper level. Our work is mission-driven and dedicated to uplifting other nonprofits that fulfill essential needs in communities, and it is with that lens that we facilitate meetings and ongoing communication between volunteers and our nonprofit partners, which leads to long-term relationship building."

    - paragraph: "We are centered around driving holistic business process change by leveraging tailored technology solutions that make nonprofit missions sustainable."
    - paragraph: "Our process begins with immersing ourselves in understanding the challenges of our nonprofit partners, and our skills-based volunteering events are no different. We begin all our events by facilitating meetings with stakeholders, since we believe that the individuals who are driving critical missions at diaper banks, animal shelters, foster youth organizations, and conservation groups, to name a few, are best positioned to explain their needs and the impact of your volunteer service. This relationship continues when we wrap up events, as stakeholders use the tools and products built by you and your team, and share their thoughts and gratitude for the efficiencies and impact your work creates."
    - paragraph: "We even go one step further! Since we have long-standing relationships with the nonprofits, we follow up with them between three to six months after the event to get real time feedback on the improvements created by the technology solutions that were built by your team. We then report back to you on these updates, so the magnitude of your contributions are acknowledged, long into the future."
